### where to start?

Even though I am writing in this post, I still haven't figured out 
what exactly I would like to talk about. One thing for sure is that, 
since I finally hook this site up with my custom domain, I would like 
to post something real up to celebrate it!

As I say in this website domain, I fidget all the time. I doodle, knit, 
crochet and sew. I used to write a lot, but not anymore. I hope this blog
becomes a stepping stone for me to start writing again. Not every writing I
did in the past was great, but being able to express myself was something 
I was proud myself of. 

### what to write?

At the moment, it could be anything.. anything I come up with, anything 
I would like to talk about. As a fidgeter, it's hard just to keep only one thing  
to write about. So yes, I will write about doodling, knitting, crocheting, 
sewing and programming. 

This post is sort of going to be a warm up for me. Writing hasn't 
been my thing when my depression got worse, actually then none of hobbies 
or activities I had used to do or enjoy couldn't be done for many years.

I don't want to give myself too much pressure to write something high quality
from the beginning, so this could be anything, and this post is exactly that, 
**anything**.
